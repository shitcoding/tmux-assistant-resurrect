# Hermetic unit tests for assistant state-directory resolution (issue #65).
#
# The state dir is a rendezvous point between two processes that never share an
# environment: the SessionStart hook writes as a child of the assistant, the save
# hook reads as a child of the tmux server. If the two resolve it differently the
# failure is silent — the save hook simply finds nothing and records no session
# ID. These tests pin that they agree.
#
# Why a separate file rather than more cases in test/run-tests.sh: that suite
# exports TMUX_ASSISTANT_RESURRECT_DIR globally at the top, which short-circuits
# the resolver before any of the interesting logic runs. That single export is
# why #65 shipped green. NOTHING HERE MAY EXPORT IT — each case sets it, or
# deliberately does not, for itself.
#
# Also unlike run-tests.sh (Docker/Linux only), this runs on macOS and Git Bash,
# which is where the real divergence lives: $TMPDIR is /var/folders/<hash>/T on
# macOS and per-login-session, so the tmux server and a freshly-launched
# assistant genuinely disagree.
#
# Run locally with:  bash test/state-dir-unit-tests.sh   (or: just test-state-dir)
